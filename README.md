Abstract
This project aims to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal. Utilizing basic image classification techniques, the study seeks to streamline the diagnostic process, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in identifying pneumonia types, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
The urgent need for rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory illnesses, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitates improvements in diagnostic methodologies. This project focuses on the classification of chest X-ray images to aid in the differentiation between COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal lung conditions without the complexity of machine learning models.

Materials and Methods
Data Collection
The dataset consists of JPEG images of chest X-rays classified into three distinct groups: COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal conditions. These images were collected from several medical databases and annotated by healthcare professionals.

Image Processing and Classification
Images were first standardized in terms of size and quality. The classification was performed based on visible signs typical of COVID-19 and other forms of pneumonia, such as patterns of lung opacity, the shape and extent of lung markings, and other radiographic features.

Results
The classification process allowed for quick categorization of the X-ray images. Initial results show a high degree of accuracy in identifying COVID-19 cases, which are critical for prioritizing treatment and isolation measures.

Conclusion
By simplifying the classification process for pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images, this project demonstrates a potential path forward for rapid diagnostic methods that can be readily applied in various healthcare settings. This approach is particularly relevant in scenarios where rapid decision-making is crucial, such as during disease outbreaks.
